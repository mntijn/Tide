# Pattern configuration for AML pattern generation
#
# IMPORTANT: Fraud amounts are REALISTIC but legitimate background patterns
# now include similar high-value transactions to prevent amount-based leakage.
# The distinguishing factor should be GRAPH STRUCTURE, not raw amounts.
#
# Key insight: Structuring (amounts just below $10K) is kept, but legitimate
# patterns also include high-value rent, insurance, and car payments in the
# same range, so amount alone doesn't predict fraud.

# Repeated Overseas Transfers Pattern

    inflows:
      min_inflows: 5
