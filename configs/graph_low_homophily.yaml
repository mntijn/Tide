# LOW FRAUD-CLASS HOMOPHILY configuration
#
# Goal: Produce a dataset where fraudulent edges are maximally dispersed across
# the graph, with minimal clustering. Same fraud rate as graph_LI.yaml (~0.10%)
# but with even lower fraud-class homophily than the current ~0.004.
#
# Design choices:
# - Aggressive layering (4-8 hops): fraud passes through many intermediary
#   accounts, spreading fraud edges across distant graph neighborhoods.
# - Broad fraud entity pool: low min_risk_score (0.25) means many different
#   entities can participate in fraud, reducing entity overlap between patterns.
# - Low reuse probability: 0.05 base probability means entities are rarely
#   selected for multiple patterns.
# - Fewer patterns (60): each pattern generates many transactions via deep
#   layering, so fewer patterns still hit the fraud ratio target.
# - Heavy legitimate high-risk activity: lots of legit noise around fraud
#   entities dilutes the structural clustering signal.
