=====================================

## THESIS-WIDE CHANGES
- Changed the title
- Wrote the abstract

## CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
- Restructured and rewrote the chapter for a more logical flow, went from three sections to seven
- Added new sections (Section 1.2, 1.3, 1.6) to introduce the context of synthetic data, graph-based neural networks, and the specific contributions of the thesis
- Condensed and rewrote existing content for better readability
- Changed the main research question

## CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW AND THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS
- Restructured the chapter to improve the logical progression of ideas
- Added an introductory paragraph to outline the chapter's content
- Added new sections on Financial Fraud (Section 2.1) and Methods for AML Detection (Section 2.3) to provide broader context
- Reorganized existing content and moved subsections (graph-based modelling now subsection 2.3.2) to more appropriate sections
- Made minor edits throughout to improve clarity and flow

## CHAPTER 3: TIDE: SYSTEM DESIGN AND ARCHITECTURE
- Updated the chapter title and added an introductory paragraph
- Clarified and refined the description of the graph model and its parameters (Section 3.4, 3.5, 3.6)
- Significantly expanded the simulation of background financial activity (Section 3.7) from a single method to a multi-pattern approach, with new subsections detailing each pattern

## CHAPTER 4: IMPLEMENTATION
- Made minor edits to improve readability
- Enhanced the description of the implementation with new diagrams and explanations for entity creation and pattern injection to better illustrate the software architecture (subsection 4.1.1, 4.1.2)
- Updated the section on the background activity simulator to reflect the new multi-pattern design (subsection 4.1.3)

## CHAPTER 5: EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
- Changed the chapter title and expanded the introduction
- Revised and refined the testing methodologies for pattern validation, scalability, and configuration compliance (Section 5.2)
- Added hardware and software specifications (Section 5.2)
- Adjusted validation metrics for scalability testing (Section 5.3)

## CHAPTER 6: EVALUATION
- Substantially updated this chapter with new results and analysis (Section 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3)
- Rewrote the introductory paragraph
- Populated the section on pattern generation with detailed validation results and updated figures (Section 6.1)
- Expanded and rewrote the scalability analysis to include memory performance, and updated results with new data and statistical analysis (Section 6.2)
- Fully wrote the section on configuration compliance, which was previously a placeholder (Section 6.3)
- Rewrote the overall assessment to provide a final conclusion based on the new results (Section 6.5)

## CHAPTER 7: CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
- Reorganized the chapter for better structure, including a new, separate section to directly answer the main research question (Section 7.1)
- Updated the summary of findings, limitations, and future work to incorporate the new evaluation results, with a new emphasis on scalability as a key limitation and area for future improvement (Section 7.2, 7.4, 7.5)
